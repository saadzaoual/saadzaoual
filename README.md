### 💡 About Me

I'm a creative technologist who blends low-level programming with visual storytelling.  
Currently grinding through the 42 Network curriculum (at 1337 BG), working on projects like `Minishell`, `Libft`, and more.  
Outside of code, I'm a videographer and editor, creating cinematic content with my Sony A7S3. I bring **precision**, **aesthetic**, and **adaptability** to every project I take on.
